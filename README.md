# Weather-Forcasting-using-LSTMs-with-multiple-look-back-variation-analysis

  Weather Forecasting using time series data analysis algorithms provides with Short term accurate solutions. As the Parameterization has been a big issue for computation of this particular problem, black box nature of time Series Data analysis overcomes the difficulty of computation time substantially. We used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting 1 future day Average Temperature. In addition, We also created a Decision Tree model to analyze and fit the output with the deviation in the multiple lookback outputs of train data with ground truth. Use of single lookback gave approximately Mean Absolute Error(MAE) of 0.2 with max error of 2 meanwhile, use of multiple lookback model with deviation analysis model provided the MAE of 0.01 with max Error 0.2.
